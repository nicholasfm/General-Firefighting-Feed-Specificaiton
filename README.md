## GFFS: An experimental standard for wildfire suppression activity feeds

The General Firefighting Feed Specification (GTFS) is a proposed data specification that allows wildland firefighting agencies to collect, stream and analyze temporal and geospatial suppression activity data in a common format.
It is modelled on the [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://gtfs.org/) data format which is used by thousands of public transport providers around the world. 


### Our Goal 

This project is intended to facilitate the consultation and co-development of a standard to support the future of wildfire supression analytics. It is intended to synthesize input from:
 - Operational persons looking to suggest requirements
 - Developers contribute to the setup of the specification
 - Non-technical persons who are looking to gain understanding the system

### Analytics in Wildfire

Ultimately the aim of developing the GFFS is to support data analytics in incident decision support, specifically for firefighter safety and tactical resource management (i.e. personnel and equipment). This ultimately feeds into a roadmap for modern operations management to minimize firefighter exposure, support spatial fire management planning, increase resource efficiency, and reduce the overall impacts and costs of wildfire incidents.
